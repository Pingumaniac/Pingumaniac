# ðŸ’¡ Life Philosophy 

1. The wheel of compensation rotates like a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Its rotation speed is initially really slow, but once it starts accelerating, it accelerates really fast. I will always do what I think is the best regardless of immediate returns. 
2. Make other people feel comfortable talking to and working with me. 
3. Minimise competition with others and let my surrounding people succeed in their fields. My surrounding people's successes are my success. 
4. Differentiate when to step forward, when to stop, and when to retreat strategically. 
5. Admire Elon Musk and learn from him as much as possible, but behave differently from him. I will employ asymmetric strategies. 
6. Large organisations need various types of people. Embrace diversity and their skills. 
7. There are no desperate situations. There are only desperate people.
