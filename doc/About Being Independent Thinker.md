# About Being Independent Thinker

I agree that knowing how to think and behave independently is a critical skill which shall be recognised and praised. 
But to be a great independent thinker, you should know how others think and behave. 
In particular, you should study how other great people think and behave. 
Analyse their strengths and weaknesses. 
Then, you develop your unique ideas and act differently, enabling you to catch new opportunities and minimise risks.

Being truly independent = a well-written reactive functional program being executed
