- 👋 Hi, I am @Pingumaniac. I love Pingu.
- 👀 I am interested in human-computer interaction (HCI), software engineering, education technology, intelligent agents, and natural language processing.
- 🌱 I am going to apply for masters programmes in computer science to further study and research how computers can better interact with us (humans) to solve problems that we (humans) face more skillfully through software engineering.
- 💣 I am interested in education, health care, and smart fashion industries.
- 💞️ I have collaborated with Professor Alexander Kuhn on developing education software at the State University of New York Korea (SUNY Korea).
