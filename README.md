# 👋 Hi, I am @Pingumaniac. 

## 👨 About Me

* 🔥 I am currently a Master's (M.Sc.) student in computer science and also a recipient of Engineering Graduate Fellowship at Vanderbilt University.
* 🌱 My M.Sc. advisor is Professor Yu Huang (黄羽 教授). She is very nice (她很好). Her success is my success.
* 🎓 I have graduated from the State University of New York Korea (SUNY Korea) with a double major in computer science (CSE), and applied mathematics and statistics (AMS). 
* 📫 Thus, I have visited Stony Brook University (SBU) during August 2021 - May 2022. 
* 🏋️‍♂️ I like to go to the gym in my free time.
* 📚 I like to read books in my free time.
* 📌 I am a commander in chief. I am always looking for chief strategists who can complete my incomplete strategies.
* 🍽️ My favourite food is Peking duck (北京烤鸭). 

## 🎲 Course Plan at Vanderbilt (Subject to change)

* 🌎 Spring 2023: CS 5891: Special Topics - The Algorithms of Robotics, CS 6315: Automated Verification, CS 6381: Distributed Systems Principles
* 🌍 Fall 2023: CS 5253: Parallel Functional Programming, CS 6376: Foundations of Hybrid and Embedded Systems, CS 6388: Model-Integrated Computing
* 🌏 Spring 2024: CS 5278: Principles of Software Engineering, CS 5891: Special Topics - Scalable Micro-services, CS 6310: Design and Analysis of Algorithms, CS 6377: Topics in Embedded Software and Systems
* 🪐 Summer 2024: CS 7999: Master's Thesis Research
* 🌙 Fall 2024: CS 5239: Cyber-Physical Systems: Foundations and Project, CS 5281: Principles of Operating Systems I, CS 7999: Master's Thesis Research

#### My plan over summer 2023 is to implement a functional programming language based on "Functional Programming Application and Implementation" by Peter Henderson. Thus, I will complete all the exercises in Scheme from "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Gerald Jay Sussman, Hal Abelson, and Julie Sussman.

## 🌕 Sample Courses that I would like to take while PhD
 
* 🌖 Systems: Compiler Optimization, Program Analysis, In-memory Database Implemenation, Distributed Database
* 🌗 Architecture: Multi-core Programming, non-Von Neumann Architecture
* 🌘 Security: Computer Systems Security, Assembly Language Reverse Engineering, Blockchain Security
* 🌒 Machine Learning: Distributed Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning Verification
* 🌓 Theory: Graph Algorithms, Parallel Algorithms, Type Theory, Quantum Algorithms
* 🌔 Graphics: 2D Game Programming, 3D Game Programming, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality

####  Note: I think every area is equivalently important. There is not a single area that is superior to the other. Thus, I will learn some of these disciplines via online (e.g. Coursera, edX, Udemy).

## 🛠 Tech stack
* 💎 Programming Languages: C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, R, Racket, SQL
* 💻 Web frameworks and libraries: Bootstrap, React.js, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, Flask
* 💊 Data Science and Machine Learning libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, PyTorch
* 🔮 UX Design Tools: Figma, Adobe XD
* 🔫 Formal Verification Tools: NuSMV, Z3 Theorem Prover, PySMT
