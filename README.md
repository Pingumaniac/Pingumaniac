# 👋 Hi, I am @Pingumaniac. 

## 👨 About Me

* 🔥 I am currently a Master's (M.Sc.) student in computer science and also a recipient of Engineering Graduate Fellowship at Vanderbilt University.
* 🌱 My M.Sc. advisor is Professor Yu Huang (黄羽 教授). She is very nice (她很好). Her success is my success.
* 🎓 I have graduated from the State University of New York Korea (SUNY Korea) with a double major in computer science (CSE), and applied mathematics and statistics (AMS). 
* 📫 Thus, I have visited Stony Brook University (SBU) during August 2021 - May 2022. 
* 🏋️‍♂️ I like to go to the gym in my free time.
* 📚 I like to read books in my free time.
* 📌 I am a commander in chief. I am always looking for clever and diligent chief strategists who can complete my incomplete strategies.
* 🍽️ My favourite food is Peking duck (北京烤鸭). Harbin lamb skewers are delicious as well.

## 🎲 Course Plan at Vanderbilt (Subject to change)

* 🌎 Spring 2023: CS 5891: Special Topics - The Algorithms of Robotics, CS 6315: Automated Verification, CS 6381: Distributed Systems Principles
* 🌍 Fall 2023: CS 5253: Parallel Functional Programming, CS 6376: Foundations of Hybrid and Embedded Systems, CS 6388: Model-Integrated Computing
* 🌏 Spring 2024: CS 5278: Principles of Software Engineering, CS 5891: Special Topics - Scalable Micro-services, CS 6310: Design and Analysis of Algorithms, CS 6377: Topics in Embedded Software and Systems
* 🪐 Summer 2024: CS 7999: Master's Thesis Research
* 🌙 Fall 2024: CS 5239: Cyber-Physical Systems: Foundations and Project, CS 5281: Principles of Operating Systems I, CS 7999: Master's Thesis Research

#### My plan over summer 2023 is to implement a functional programming language based on "Functional Programming Application and Implementation" by Peter Henderson. Thus, I will complete all the exercises in Scheme from "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Gerald Jay Sussman, Hal Abelson, and Julie Sussman.

## 🌕 Sample Courses that I would like to take while PhD
 
* 🌖 Systems: Compiler Optimization, Program Analysis, In-memory Database Implemenation, Distributed Database
* 🌗 Architecture: Multi-core Programming, non-Von Neumann Architecture
* 🌘 Security: Computer Systems Security, Assembly Language Reverse Engineering, Blockchain Security
* 🌒 Machine Learning: Distributed Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning Verification
* 🌓 Theory: Graph Algorithms, Parallel Algorithms, Type Theory, Quantum Algorithms
* 🌔 Graphics and Game Programming: 2D Game Programming, 3D Game Programming, AR/VR Game Programming, Non-fungible token (NFT) games

####  Note: I think every area is equivalently important. There is not a single area that is superior to the other. Thus, I will learn some of these disciplines via online (e.g. Coursera, edX, Udemy).

## 🛠 Tech stack
* 💎 Programming Languages: C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, R, Racket, SQL
* 💻 Web frameworks and libraries: Bootstrap, React.js, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, Flask
* 💊 Data Science and Machine Learning libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, PyTorch
* 🔮 UX Design Tools: Figma, Adobe XD
* 🔫 Formal Verification Tools: NuSMV, Z3 Theorem Prover, PySMT

## 💡 Life Philosophy

1. The wheel of compensation rotates like a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Its rotation speed is initally really slow, but once it starts accelerating, it accelerates really fast. I will do what I think is the best all the time regardless of immediate returns.
2. Make other people feel comfortable when they talk to me and work with me.
3. Minimise competition with other people and let my surrounding people succeed in their fields. My surrounding people's successes are my success.
4. Treat everyone as my potential consumers.
5. Differentiate when to step forward, when to stop, and when to strategically retreat.
6. Admire Elon Musk and learn from him as much as possible, but behave differently from him. I will employ assymmetric strategies.
7. Large organisations need various types of people. Embrace diversity and their skills. 
8. There are no desperate situations. There are only desperate people.
9. Always work in a standard that the world expects. The standard that the world expects is extremely high and it is my duty to always achieve it.
10. Be a visionaire. The world is large and there are a lot of things to do.
11. Be sensitive about how consumer behavior changes over time for various markets.
12. Be sensitive about how the supply-side factors change over time for various markets.
