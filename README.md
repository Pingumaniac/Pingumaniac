- 👋 Hi, I am @Pingumaniac. 
- 📫 I have graduated from the State University of New York Korea (SUNY Korea) with a double major in computer science (CSE), and applied mathematics and statistics (AMS). Thus, I was a visiting student at Stony Brook University (SBU) for August 2021 - May 2022. 
- 🙏 I am working on my Coursera courses and my applications to graduate schools in computer science.
- 👀 My research interests lie in creating an AR/VR game engine using Rust and creating a custom compiler for optimization.
- 🏋️‍♂️ I like to go to the gym in my free time.
- 📚 I like to read books in my free time.
