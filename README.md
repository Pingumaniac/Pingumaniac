## 💡 Life Philosophy

1. The wheel of compensation rotates like a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Its rotation speed is initially really slow, but once it starts accelerating, it accelerates really fast. I will always do what I think is the best regardless of immediate returns.
2. Make other people feel comfortable talking to and working with me.
3. Minimise competition with others and let my surrounding people succeed in their fields. My surrounding people's successes are my success.
4. Differentiate when to step forward, when to stop, and when to retreat strategically .
5. Admire Elon Musk and learn from him as much as possible, but behave differently from him. I will employ asymmetric strategies.
6. Large organisations need various types of people. Embrace diversity and their skills. 
7. There are no desperate situations. There are only desperate people.
8. Always work to a standard that the world expects. The standard that the world expects is extraordinarily high, and I must consistently achieve it.
9. Be a visionary. The world is large, and there are a lot of things to do.
10. Be sensitive about how consumer behaviour changes over time for various markets.
11. Be sensitive about how the supply-side factors change over time for various markets.
12. Ideas worth only high when they can be employed in the real-world and commercialised.
