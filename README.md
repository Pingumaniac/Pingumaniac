- 👋 Hi, I am @Pingumaniac
- 👀 I am interested in human-computer interaction (HCI), software engineering, education technology, intelligent agents, and natural language processing.
- 🌱 I am going to apply for masters programmes in computer science to further study and research how computers can better interact with humans to solve problems that we (humans) face more skillfully through software engineering.
- 💞️ I have collaborated with Professor Alexander Kuhn on developing education software at the State University of New York Korea (SUNY Korea).
- 📫 Currently, I am a visiting student at Stony Brook University.
