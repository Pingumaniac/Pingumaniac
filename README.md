- 👋 Hi, I am @Pingumaniac. 
- 🔥 I am an incoming M.Sc. in computer science student at Vanderbilt University.
- 📫 I have graduated from the State University of New York Korea (SUNY Korea) with a double major in computer science (CSE), and applied mathematics and statistics (AMS). Thus, I have visited Stony Brook University (SBU) during August 2021 - May 2022. 
- 👀 My research interests lie in compiler design for WebAssembly and game engines, programming languages based on WebAssembly. Thus, I am also interested in expanding my knowledge in cloud-streaming games, computer graphics and GPU programming.
- 🏋️‍♂️ I like to go to the gym in my free time.
- 📚 I like to read books in my free time.
